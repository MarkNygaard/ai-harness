 * Everything is public documentation, so everything is crawlable.
 *
 * The AI crawlers are named explicitly rather than left to the wildcard. Several
 * of them are opt-*out* by default but are judged by operators on whether a site
 * states its position, and a few (Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended) only ever
 * read a directive addressed to them by name — a bare `User-agent: *` says
 * nothing to those. For a project that wants to be found by people asking an
 * assistant how to orchestrate coding agents, being citable is the point.
